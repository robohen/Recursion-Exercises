Recursion exercises that were done following the curriculum of the Odin Project.

Fibonacci is used on the first exercise, it has a function which takes a number and returns an array containing the numbers in the fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci sequence is a sequence that starts with 0 and then two 1s and steadily increases, for example if you use the number 8 the array should return with [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]. Recursion is used to make this assignment possible.

The second uses recursive merge sort in an array and returns the sorted version of the numbers plugged in.
